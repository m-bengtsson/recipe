        <h2>Thai-Style Coconut–Green Curry Chicken Soup</h2>
        <p>
          Thai cooks make curry pastes by slowly grinding herbs and aromatic
          ingredients in a mortar. Since making even a small amount can take as
          long as an hour, many cooks buy canned curry pastes, which never
          deliver the headiness of freshly made. To avoid this dilemma, simmer
          the same aromatic ingredients in broth and leave them chopped, sliced,
          or whole. Thai soups and curries get their character from lemon- or
          lime-flavored ingredients, such as lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves
          or rind (regular lime zest can be used as a substitute); galangal,
          which looks a little like ginger but tastes like pine resin; chiles;
          cilantro; coconut milk; fish sauce for savor and saltiness; and lime
          juice or tamarind for tang. While some of these ingredients may
          require mail order or a trip to an Asian market, they will keep in the
          freezer for months.

          <li>1 quart chicken broth</li>
          <li>3 shallots</li>
          <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
          <li>
            2 slices fresh, frozen, or dried galangal, ¼ inch thick (optional)
          </li>
          <li>
            2 to 4 Thai chiles, or 4 to 8 jalapeño chiles, seeded and finely
            chopped
          </li>
          <li>
            1 stalk lemongrass, white bulb part only, tough outer layer
            discarded, very thinly sliced
          </li>
          <li>3 kaffir lime leaves or zest of 1 lime, in strips</li>
          <li>¼ cup fish sauce, plus more to taste</li>
          <li>Juice of 3 limes</li>
          <li>One 15-ounce can unsweetened coconut milk</li>
          <li>
            1 small bunch cilantro, large stems removed and leaves chopped
          </li>
          <li>
            1½ cups (½-inch) cubed cooked chicken, or 2 raw boneless, skinless
            chicken breasts, cut into ½-inch cubes
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <span>
          In a pot, combine the broth, shallots, garlic, galangal, chiles,
          lemongrass, and lime leaves and bring to a simmer. Simmer gently for
          15 minutes. Add the fish sauce, lime juice, coconut milk, cilantro,
          and chicken. If using cooked chicken, simmer for about 1 minute, or
          until the liquid is piping hot and the chicken is heated through. If
          using raw chicken, simmer for about 4 minutes, or until the chicken is
          cooked. Taste for salt and add more fish sauce—it is very salty and
          will contribute flavor—until the salt level is right.
