          <h1>Thai-Style Coconut–Green Curry Chicken Soup</h1>
          <p>
            Thai cooks make curry pastes by slowly grinding herbs and aromatic
            ingredients in a mortar. Since making even a small amount can take
            as long as an hour, many cooks buy canned curry pastes, which never
            deliver the headiness of freshly made. To avoid this dilemma, simmer
            the same aromatic ingredients in broth and leave them chopped,
            sliced, or whole. Thai soups and curries get their character from
            lemon- or lime-flavored ingredients, such as lemongrass and kaffir
            lime leaves or rind (regular lime zest can be used as a substitute);
            galangal, which looks a little like ginger but tastes like pine
            resin; chiles; cilantro; coconut milk; fish sauce for savor and
            saltiness; and lime juice or tamarind for tang. While some of these
            ingredients may require mail order or a trip to an Asian market,
            they will keep in the freezer for months.

            <li>
              In a pot, combine the broth, shallots, garlic, galangal, chiles,
              lemongrass, and lime leaves and bring to a simmer. Simmer gently
              for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the fish sauce, lime juice, coconut milk, cilantro, and
              chicken. If using cooked chicken, simmer for about 1 minute, or
              until the liquid is piping hot and the chicken is heated through.
              If using raw chicken, simmer for about 4 minutes, or until the
              chicken is cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the fish sauce, lime juice, coconut milk, cilantro, and
              chicken. If using cooked chicken, simmer for about 1 minute, or
              until the liquid is piping hot and the chicken is heated through.
              If using raw chicken, simmer for about 4 minutes, or until the
              chicken is cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
              Taste for salt and add more fish sauce—it is very salty and will
              contribute flavor—until the salt level is right.
